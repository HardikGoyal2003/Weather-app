## Proof that changes are correct

<!--
Add videos/screenshots of the user-facing interface to demonstrate that the changes
made in this PR work correctly. (For changes involving responsiveness or adjustment
of UI elements, this should be a video that gradually resizes the viewport from wide
to narrow and back again.) If this PR is for a developer-facing feature, provide
the videos/screenshots of developer-facing interface. Please also include
videos/screenshots of the developer tools browser console, so that we can be sure
that there are no console errors.

When you make updates to the PR, please update these videos/screenshots as well.
You can drop videos/screenshots from previous versions of the PR.

The above should be done for all PRs, including short ones (e.g. a single-line change).
However, if the changes in your PRs are autogenerated via a script and you cannot
provide proof for the changes then please leave a comment "No proof of changes
needed because {{Reason}}" and remove all the sections below.
